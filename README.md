* Introduction: 
    Nowadays student activities are playing a major role reshaping campus life. Extracurriculars allow
    students to pursue interests outside of a standardized academic context. Students can also use these
    activities to explore interests they've never encountered, exposing students to a more diverse range of
    interests.

    Correspondingly there has been a significant increase in the number of student activities and level of
    participation, a thing that made communication between student activities and their targeted audience a
    cumbersome process considering the baffling number of important dates and upcoming events that
    participants have to keep track of.

    The rapid increase in the size of student activities and the level of participation posed the challenge of
    finding suitable event venues that have the capacity of accommodating such numbers, let alone facilitating
    the process of finding these places, acquiring credible information regarding them and making
    reservations.

    Bearing that in mind, we decided to take on this challenge, we thought about creating a single platform
    that would allow student activities to communicate with students, co-working spaces and event venues.
    Also a platform for students to explore student activities, get to know more about their agendas and what
    they have to offer in an organized, fully customizable way. And thus, we are introducing “ Campus ”!
    “ Campus ” is a comprehensive application targeting student activities, providing a full range of
    functionalities to cover all their needs in an organized, fully customizable way.

    “ Campus ” helps student activities to showcase their upcoming events, workshops, booths, etc. Moreover it
    helps student activities track the progress of their events, get statistics about participants and many more.
    “ Campus ” also enables student activities to view all nearby co-working spaces and events venues with a
    variety of details such as prices, venue capacity, availability, special services, offers and even the option of
    making an online reservation!

    We at “ Campus” hold user’s convenience at a high regard, and thus “ Campus ” is to be made user friendly,
    self-explanatory, it will integrate other useful services such as google maps as well.
    Life has never been easier!
